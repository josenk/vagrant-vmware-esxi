    #  A NOTE about esxi_password / ssh keys!!

    #  OPTIONAL.  Guest VM name to be created/used.

    #    The default is to use the number of virt cpus specified
    #     in the vmx file, however you can specify a new value here.
    #esxi.numvcpus = "2"

    #  OPTIONAL.  Resource Pool
    #    The default is to create VMs in the "root".  You can
    #     specify a resource pool here to partition memory and
    #     cpu usage away from other systems on your esxi host.
    #     The resource pool must already exist and be configured.
    #     Vagrant will NOT create it for you.

    #  DANGEROUS!  Allow Overwrite
    #    Set this to 'True' will overwrite existing VMs (with the same name)
    #    when you run vagrant up.   ie,  if the vmname already exists,
    #    it will be destroyed, then over written...  This is helpful
    #    if you have a VM that became an orphan (vagrant lost association).
    #    This will also overwrite your box when using vagrant package.
